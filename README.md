# The Follow-up of &Uuml;ber-cool New Students: The *F&Uuml;N* Study

This is a simulated dataset for instructional purposes, to be used as part of the 
Harvard University Population Health Science (PHS) PhD End of Summer Camp
Workshop. The F&Uuml;N Study is a survey of doctoral students pursuing health
related degrees. As part of the study, information on the following variables 
was collected: 

- `W`: Whether the student is currently in their "dissertating" stage of their PhD career. 
- `A.con`: The number of hours a student slept last night.
- `A.bin`: Whether the student slept at least 8 hours last night.
- `Y.con`: The number of times a student used a food delivery service last week (as opposed to cooking).
- `Y.bin`: Whether the student used a food delivery service for more than 50\% of the week's meals
